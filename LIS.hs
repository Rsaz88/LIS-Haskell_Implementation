I implemented the naÃ¯ve approach to solve LIS. 
Furthermore, I tried to came up with an approach to reduce 
the complexity by implementing (Halving Quick Sort)
in which I tried to utilize the idea of choosing the first 
element of the list as the pivot in a Quick sort algorithm. 
However, such an approach failed to find all possible LIS.
