# LIS-Haskell_Implementation
This repository contains an implementation of  LIS problem in Haskell
## There are two ways to run this code: 
### 1- Online compilers :
If it's your first time using Haskell, I highly recommend you to start with one of the online compilers.
Here is a useful one that I use :

### 2- Run code locally on your computer: 
If you would like to run the code locally you need to install Haskell :
 - I prefer to use Chocolatey. If you have it already installed, just follow the steps in this tutorial :
